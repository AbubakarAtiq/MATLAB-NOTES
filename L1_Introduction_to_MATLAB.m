Introduction
1. Stands for MATrix LABoratory
2. A special purpose computer program optimized to performed engineering
and scientific calculations.
3.Or it is a technical programming language.
4. Started with simple matrix manipulation and grown with the capability of
solving any technical problem.
5. A proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks.
6. It provides a very extensive library of predefined functions to make
technical programming task easier and more efficient.
7. Superior on other language like C, FORTRAN.
8. MATLAB can be interfaced with various hardwares like TMS320C6713,
Ardunio, FPGA, NI DAQ etc. to enhance the data processing capabilities of
MATLAB.
%*Research, Development, and Design challenges*
1. Demands on engineers and scientists are increasing
    1.1 Proliferation of products and technologies
    1.2 Decreased development time and product life cycles
    1.3 Pressure to meet deadlines, while evaluating design tradeoffs
    1.4 Variety of projects and tasks that are rarely straightforward
2. Experimenting and programming is expensive.
%*MATLAB Capabilities*
1. Numerical computation
2. Data access
3. Data analysis and visualization
4. Programming and algorithm development
5. Application Development and Deployment
%*Data Access and Connectivity to measurement Hardware*
1. Data Access
    1.1 Standard and scientific data and file formats
    1.2 Excel
    1.3 Databases
2. Hardware connectivity
    2.1 Data Acquisition hardware
    2.2 Stand alone instruments and devices
%*Data Analysis and Visualization*
1. Preprocessing
2. Fast and accurate analysis
    2.1 Correlation
    2.2  Fourier analysis and filtering
    2.3 Basic stats and curve fitting
3. Built-in graphics for engineering and science
    3.1 2-D plots, 3-D graphics and volume visualization
    3.2 Interactive tools to annotate, analyze, and customize
%*Advantage of MATLAB for technical programming*
1. Easy to use
2. Platform independent
3. Pre-defined functions
4. Device independent plotting
5. Graphical user interface
6. MATLAB complier
%%
% *Disadvantages*
1. Slow speed: Interpreted language rather than complied one.
    solution: by properly structuring the MATLAB program
2. Cost: only cost effective for business.
% *Alternatives to MATLAB*
1. MATLAB is an excellent softwate, but it is commerical and its price is
very high. Other alternatives are available (Octave, Scilab, Freemat) but
each one has pros and cons.
% *Applications*
1. Technical computing
MATLAB and toolboxes for mathematical computation, analysis, visualization,
and algorithm development.
2. Control Design
Simulink, MATLAB, and related tools for model-based design of control
systems, from analysis of algorithms to modeling and simulation, rapid
prototyping, and code generation for embedded systems.
3. DSP and Communications design
Simulink, MATLAB, and related tools for system-level design of DSP and
communication systems, from algorithm development to simulation, rapid
prototyping, and verification.
4. Test and Measurement
MATLAB tools for communicating with and collecting data from external
hardware.
5. Image processing
MATLAB tools for image processing, from data import to analysis,
enchancement, and application development
6. Financial Modeling and analysis
