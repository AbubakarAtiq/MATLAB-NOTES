1.Linear control system lab manual presents a series of experiments dealing with all
topics covered in theory course Linear Control systems and provides an introduction to 
control system starting with open loop control to feedback control system.
2.Each experiment is accompanied by a set of objectives, a list of equipmet required followed
by a discussion of theoretical concepts that are investigated or analyzed. After each experiment,
students are required to comment on the results of the experiment and the lab exercise.
3.The sequence and scope of the experiments in this manual are related to the theoretical
material covered in the text book and analysis based on control system application.
All the experiments have been tested and revised where necessary to improve clarity.
Any comments or suggestions to improve the style, scope or clarity of any experiment are welcome.
